Why Am I Unable to Download an Object?
======================================

-  Check whether the network connectivity between the local computer and OBS is normal. If the network is down, restore the network connection.
-  Check whether the account has the permissions needed to download objects from the bucket. This check should cover IAM policies, bucket policies, object policies, bucket ACLs, and object ACLs. If the account does not have the required permissions, grant the permissions first.
-  If the fault persists, contact the administrator.
