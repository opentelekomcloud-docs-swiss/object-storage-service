Why Am I Unable to Upload an Object?
====================================

-  Check whether the network connectivity between the local computer and OBS is normal. If the network is faulty, restore the network connection.
-  If a message indicating "service unavailable" is displayed when objects are being uploaded, try again later.
-  Check whether the account has the permissions required to upload objects. This check should cover the IAM policies, bucket policies, and bucket ACLs. If the account does not have the required permissions, grant the permissions first.
-  If the fault persists, contact the administrator.
