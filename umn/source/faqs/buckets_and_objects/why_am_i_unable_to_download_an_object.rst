Why Am I Unable to Download an Object?
======================================

-  Check whether the network connectivity between the local computer and OBS is normal. If the network is down, restore the network connectivity.
-  Check whether account has the permissions needed to download objects from the bucket. Check the IAM policies, bucket policies, object policies, bucket ACLs, and object ACLs. If the account does not have the required permissions, obtain them first.
-  If the fault persists, contact the administrator.
