Why Am I Unable to Upload an Object?
====================================

-  Check whether the network connectivity between the local computer and OBS is normal. If the network is down, restore the network connectivity.
-  If a message indicating "service unavailable" is displayed when objects are being uploaded, try again later.
-  Check whether account has the permissions required to upload objects. This includes the IAM policies, bucket policies, and bucket ACLs. If you do not have the permissions needed, obtain the permission first.
-  If the fault persists, contact the administrator.
