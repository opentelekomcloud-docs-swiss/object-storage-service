Obtaining Access Keys (AK/SK)
=============================

When calling an API, you need to use the AK/SK to verify the signature. To obtain the AK/SK, perform the following steps:

#. Log in to the console.
#. Hover the cursor on the username in the upper right corner and select **My Credentials** from the drop-down list.
#. On the **My Credentials** page, click **Manage Access Keys**.
#. Click **Add Access Key**. The **Add Access Key** dialog box is displayed.
#. Enter the password for login.
#. Enter the authentication code received in your email or mobile phone.

   .. note::

      For users created through IAM, if no email address or mobile number is specified during user creation, only the login password needs to be authenticated.

#. Click **OK** to download the access key file.

   .. note::

      Keep the AK/SK file properly to prevent information leakage.
